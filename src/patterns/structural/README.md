# Structural Design Patterns

## Overview

Structural design patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They simplify relationships between different components by identifying how these components can be connected effectively, enhancing flexibility and efficiency in the system architecture.

## Core Concepts

Structural patterns focus on:

- Composing classes and objects into larger structures
- Identifying relationships between different components
- Decoupling interface and implementation
- Enhancing flexibility of composed structures
- Adapting incompatible interfaces to work together

## Common Challenges Addressed

- Connecting different interfaces or systems that wouldn't naturally work together
- Creating class hierarchies with flexible composition
- Adding responsibilities to objects dynamically
- Simplifying complex subsystems without hiding their flexibility
- Optimizing memory usage by sharing common state across multiple objects

## Available Structural Patterns

This repository contains examples of the following structural design patterns:

- [Adapter](adapter/README.md) - Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together
- [Bridge](bridge/README.md) - Separates an abstraction from its implementation
- [Composite](composite/README.md) - Composes objects into tree structures to represent hierarchies
- [Decorator](decorator/README.md) - Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically without modifying their code
- [Facade](facade/README.md) - Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
- [Flyweight](flyweight/README.md) - Minimizes memory usage by sharing common data between objects
- [Proxy](proxy/README.md) - Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it

## Most Common Usage (By Popularity)

1. **Adapter** - Widely used when integrating with external systems and libraries
2. **Facade** - Common in creating simplified APIs and service wrappers
3. **Decorator** - Popular for adding functionality to objects without changing their interface
4. **Composite** - Often used in UI frameworks, file systems, and component hierarchies
5. **Proxy** - Frequently used for access control, lazy loading, and remote operations
6. **Bridge** - Used when separating abstraction from implementation is critical
7. **Flyweight** - Used in memory-intensive applications to optimize performance
