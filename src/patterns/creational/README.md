# Creational Design Patterns

## Overview

Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. They abstract the instantiation process, helping to make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

## Core Concepts

Creational patterns focus on:

- Encapsulating knowledge about specific classes the system uses
- Hiding how instances of these classes are created and combined
- Providing flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, how it's created, and when

## Common Challenges Addressed

- Complex object construction requiring multiple steps
- Creating objects without exposing the creation logic
- Creating objects based on runtime conditions
- Creating objects while reusing existing objects
- Ensuring a single instance of a class exists

## Available Creational Patterns

This repository contains examples of the following creational design patterns:

- [Factory](factory/README.md) - Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic
- [Builder](builder/README.md) - Separates object construction from its representation
- [Prototype](prototype/README.md) - Creates new objects by copying existing objects
- [Singleton](singleton/README.md) - Ensures a class has only one instance

## Most Common Usage (By Popularity)

1. **Factory** - Used extensively in frameworks and libraries for object creation abstraction
2. **Singleton** - Common for managing shared resources like database connections
3. **Builder** - Popular for creating complex objects with many configuration options
4. **Prototype** - Useful when object creation is more expensive than copying
