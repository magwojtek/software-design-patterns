# Behavioral Design Patterns

## Overview

Behavioral design patterns focus on communication between objects, how they interact and distribute responsibilities. These patterns address the assignment of responsibilities between objects and how they communicate effectively, increasing flexibility in carrying out communication.

## Core Concepts

Behavioral patterns focus on:

- Defining communication patterns between objects
- Distributing responsibilities among objects
- Encapsulating behavior in separate objects
- Increasing flexibility in how objects communicate
- Reducing coupling between communicating objects

## Common Challenges Addressed

- Managing complex control flows between objects
- Defining how objects delegate operations to each other
- Creating reusable communication patterns
- Implementing flexible algorithms that can be interchanged
- Capturing requests as objects to pass, queue, or handle later

## Available Behavioral Patterns

This repository contains examples of the following behavioral design patterns:

- [Observer](observer/README.md) - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified
- [Command](command/README.md) - Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests and queue or log requests
- [Iterator](iterator/README.md) - Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
- [Strategy](strategy/README.md) - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable
- [Memento](memento/README.md) - Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so it can be restored later, without violating encapsulation
- [Visitor](visitor/README.md) - Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate, allowing you to add new operations without modifying the object structure
- [Template method](template-method/README.md) - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses without changing the algorithm's structure
- [Chain of Responsibility](chain-of-responsibility/README.md) - Passes a request along a chain of handlers, with each handler deciding to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain
- [State](state/README.md) - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if the object's class had changed
- [Mediator](mediator/README.md) - Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly
- [Interpreter](interpreter/README.md) - Defines a way to interpret sentences in a domain-specific language

## Most Common Usage (By Popularity)

1. **Observer** - Widely used for event handling, reactive programming, and implementing notification systems
2. **Strategy** - Common in frameworks that need to switch between different algorithms at runtime
3. **Command** - Popular for implementing undo/redo functionality, queues, and transaction systems
4. **Iterator** - Fundamental to collections frameworks and uniform data traversal
5. **Template Method** - Frequently used in frameworks where common algorithms can be customized through inheritance
6. **Chain of Responsibility** - Used in request processing pipelines, middleware systems, and event handling frameworks
7. **State** - Common in workflow management, game development, and UI interaction handling
8. **Mediator** - Valuable in complex UI components, air traffic control systems, and chat applications
9. **Visitor** - Used in compilers, document object models, and complex data structures requiring operations
10. **Memento** - Common in undo/redo functionality, game development, and UI interaction handling
11. **Interpreter** - Used in compilers, document object models, and complex data structures requiring operations
