# Behavioral Design Patterns

## Overview

Behavioral design patterns focus on communication between objects, how they interact and distribute responsibilities. These patterns address the assignment of responsibilities between objects and how they communicate effectively, increasing flexibility in carrying out communication.

## Core Concepts

Behavioral patterns focus on:

- Defining communication patterns between objects
- Distributing responsibilities among objects
- Encapsulating behavior in separate objects
- Increasing flexibility in how objects communicate
- Reducing coupling between communicating objects

## Common Challenges Addressed

- Managing complex control flows between objects
- Defining how objects delegate operations to each other
- Creating reusable communication patterns
- Implementing flexible algorithms that can be interchanged
- Capturing requests as objects to pass, queue, or handle later

## Available Behavioral Patterns

This repository contains examples of the following behavioral design patterns:

- [Observer](observer/README.md) - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified
- [Command](command/README.md) - Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests and queue or log requests
- [Iterator](iterator/README.md) - Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
- [Strategy](strategy/README.md) - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable
- TBD next examples

## Most Common Usage (By Popularity)

1. **Observer** - Widely used for event handling, reactive programming, and implementing notification systems
2. **Strategy** - Common in frameworks that need to switch between different algorithms at runtime
3. **Command** - Popular for implementing undo/redo functionality, queues, and transaction systems
4. **Iterator** - Fundamental to collections frameworks and uniform data traversal
